# FOTOCOPS- a ELA based algorithm using CNN to classify images as fake and original 
It was the first version of the project that I created, later made changes in the front api and created a new repository as FotoCops ELA 
One more repository is created FotoCops ManTra NET which uses the ManTraNET CNN architecture to localise the forged region
